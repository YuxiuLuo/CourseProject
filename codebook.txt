The set of original variables were estimated from signals collected using smart phones during different levels of activities.
They are all normalised to [-1,1] - unitless and are listed as follows:
- mean(): mean value
- std(): standard deviation
- mad(): median absolute deviation
- max(): maximum value
- min(): minimum value
- sma(): signal magnitude area
- energy(): energy measure (sum of the squares divided by the no. of values)
- iqr(): interquartile range
- entropy(): signal entropy
- arCoeff(): autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
- correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
- maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
- meanFreq(): weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
- skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
- kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
- bandsEnergy(): energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the Fast Fourier Transform of each window
- angle(): angle between some vectors


Creating tidy dataset (clean.txt):
1. 181 rows/obs
2. 81 columns/features

The features consist of the following:
1. subject column (Subject) identifies who conducted the experiment: e.g. 1 - 30
2. activity column (Activity) separates different levels of activities: e.g. WALKING, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
3. 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables: e.g. Body Acceleration, Time.BodyAcceleration.XYZ, Frequency.BodyAcceleration.XYZ
